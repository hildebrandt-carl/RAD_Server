# Team RAD - Server

This is the RAD teams web server. 

## About

The server will act as the communication link between all of our devices. The web server keeps track of connections and what each connection is used for. The web server then takes the information from each of the devices and decides if they should be forwarded and if so where they should be forwarded to.
